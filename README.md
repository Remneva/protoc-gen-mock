#protoc-gen-mock
A plugin to generate gRPC mock services based on protobuf specifications. The generated mocks can be used for:

* Mocking a dependent service for testing purposes
* Stub a dependent service during development (while the real service is not implemented yet)

See the [wiki](https://github.com/carvalhorr/protoc-gen-mock/wiki) for details on how to set it up.
